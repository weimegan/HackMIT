## Problem Statement
How might we help young children struggling with dysgraphia and other writing disabilities improve their handwriting?

## Background
Current treatment for dysgraphia:
* Therapist holding the child’s hand to help them write
  * Not scalable
* Pencil grip and writing frame
  * Not interactive

## Solution
Our robot Jami will provide an interactive experience to help children write.

Using the Rev.ai speech to text API, the child can say a letter or a word, which will then be transcribed. The Arduino will receive the text from the speech and write it out.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating all of the parts together: sending in the letter commands from the transcript to the Arduino

## What we learned
* API integration
* Arduino
* Webapps

## What's next for HackMIT
* Improve hardware design to make it more user friendly to children
* Learn from child’s strengths/weaknesses to develop better methods to teach them how to write
* Display and share results of improvement to other children struggling with dysgraphia
